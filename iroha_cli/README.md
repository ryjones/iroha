# Iroha Application

## Description

When you start your own ledger, Iroha Application will make peers in it up and running
based on predefined configuration.

## Usage

### Generating Keys

Before deployment each Peer should generate own pair of crypthographic keys. In our example we will use `Ed25519` and 
[iroha_crypto_cli](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/iroha2-dev/iroha_crypto_cli/README.md) tool. This tool is a recommended way to generate iroha keys.

```bash
./iroha_crypto_cli
```

As a result you will see something like that:

```bash
Public key (multihash): ed0120bdf918243253b1e731fa096194c8928da37c4d3226f97eebd18cf5523d758d6c
Private key: 0311152fad9308482f51ca2832fdfab18e1c74f36c6adb198e3ef0213fe42fd8bdf918243253b1e731fa096194c8928da37c4d3226f97eebd18cf5523d758d6c
Digest function: ed25519
```

### Configuration

All the parameters are configured in `config.json` file. The full documentation of each parameters is available [here](../docs/source/references/config.md). The values specified in the config can be overwritten by environment variables.

### Manual Deployment

All the commands are assumed to be executed in the root directory of the clone of this repository in Unix bash compatible shell.

#### Make a Directory for Deployment

```bash
mkdir iroha_deploy
```

#### Build Iroha Binary

Build and copy Iroha binary into the directory. 

```bash
cargo build
cp ./target/debug/iroha_cli iroha_deploy
```

#### Copy configs

Copy and if necessary edit config, genesis and trusted peers.
```bash
cp ./iroha/config.json iroha_deploy
cp ./iroha/genesis.json iroha_deploy
cp ./iroha/trusted_peers.json iroha_deploy
```

Depending on how many peers you plan to run, update the config:
- 1 Peer - set `"MAX_FAULTY_PEERS": 0`, and set `trusted_peers.json` to only contain this peer id.
- N Peer - set `"MAX_FAULTY_PEERS": F`, where 0 < F <= (N - 1)/3, and set `trusted_peers.json` to contain ids of the peers you are planning to start.

Also update the `PUBLIC_KEY`, `PRIVATE_KEY`, `TORII_P2P_ADDR` and `TORII_API_URL` correspondingly, they should be unique for each of the peers. `trusted_peers.json` address fields should correspond to `TORII_P2P_URL`s of peers.

#### Start Iroha

Start Iroha peer. It can be done either with `--genesis` param to specify `genesis.json` location or without. Pay attention that for multipeer setup only one peer should be started with `--genesis` param.  

```bash
cd iroha_deploy
./iroha_cli --genesis="genesis.json"
```

### Docker Compose Deployment

To change configuration for this type of deployment use either environment variables in `docker-compose.yml` or change `config.json` that the `Dockerfile` references.

#### Updating Keys

See [generating keys](#generating-keys) for information on how to generate keys for your peers. You can skip this step for a test setup, then Iroha peers will use already generated testing keys from this repository.

Paste these values into `docker-compose.yml` environment variables for the first Iroha Peer:

```yaml
version: "3.3"
services:
  iroha:
    build: .
    image: iroha:debug
    environment:
      TORII_URL: iroha:1337
      IROHA_PUBLIC_KEY: 'ed0120bdf918243253b1e731fa096194c8928da37c4d3226f97eebd18cf5523d758d6c'
      IROHA_PRIVATE_KEY: '{"digest_function": "ed25519", "payload": "0311152fad9308482f51ca2832fdfab18e1c74f36c6adb198e3ef0213fe42fd8bdf918243253b1e731fa096194c8928da37c4d3226f97eebd18cf5523d758d6c"}'
...
```

Repeat this for each Peer, and do not forget to update `IROHA_TRUSTED_PEERS` correspondingly. 

Also take a look at the reference configurations for a [single peer](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/iroha2-dev/docker-compose-single.yml)
and for [multiple peers](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/iroha2-dev/docker-compose.yml).

#### Build Images

```bash
docker-compose build
```

#### Run Containers

```bash
docker-compose up
```

If you want to keep containers up and running after closing the terminal, use *detached* flag:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Stop Containers

```bash
docker-compose stop
```

#### Remove Containers

```bash
docker-compose down
```
